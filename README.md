# CPP-Assignments
This collection of .cpp and .hpp files are the completed assignments
from my Intro to Computer Science I and II classes. These are simple C++ programs
meant for learning important developer concepts.
The Intro II class shows more developed examples of using Object Oriented programming to solve different problems.
