# OSU - Assignments
These coding projects were completed as a distance student with Oregon State University.

# CS 161 and 162
These collections of .cpp and .hpp files are the completed assignments
from my Intro to Computer Science I and II classes. These are simple C++ programs
meant for learning important developer concepts.
The Intro II class shows more developed examples of using Object Oriented programming to solve different problems.
The Final Project folder is an especially complicated program that includes dynamic lists that create a grid, multiple objects of a polymorphic class, and a system of locks and keys that restrict movement around a map. Download the file, enter it, and enter 'make' into the command line to build the project, then './prog' to run it!

# Coming Soon: CS 261 and 271
These two classes, Data Structures and Computer Architecture & Assembly Language, are currently in session. Projects in C and MASM Assembly will be uploaded over the next few weeks!
