# OSU - Assignments
These coding projects were completed as a distance student with Oregon State University.

# CS 161 and 162 - Introduction to CS I and II
These collections of .cpp and .hpp files are the completed assignments
from my Intro to Computer Science I and II classes. These are simple C++ programs
meant for learning important developer concepts.
The Intro II class shows more developed examples of using Object Oriented programming to solve different problems.
The Final Project folder is an especially complicated program that includes dynamic lists that create a grid, multiple objects of a polymorphic class, and a system of locks and keys that restrict movement around a map. Download the file, enter it, and enter 'make' into the command line to build the project, then './prog' to run it!

# CS 271 - Computer Architecture and Assembly Language
A collection of MASM projects for the Computer Architecture and Assembly Language class.

#CS 290 - Web Development
These projects focused on working with HTML, CSS, and Javascript together to create dynamic web pages. Web applications wer built using NodeJS.

# In Progress:
The projects for the Winter 2017 courses (Operating Systems, Software Development I) are being uploaded as they are completed.
